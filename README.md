This repository contains analysis programs for diagnosis of experiment equipment (e.g. data acquisition hardware), input setting performance (e.g. SiPM bias voltage, trigger parameters), and more. Plot histograms, scatter plots, curve fit parameters, bar plots, etc. to measure the Rayleigh scattering length.
