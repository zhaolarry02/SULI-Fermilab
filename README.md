Repository of Python scripts written for hardware operation and data analysis in a liquid argon Rayleigh scattering length measurement project.

Hardware:
Operate various experiment components, including:
1. Monochromator
2. Shutter
3. Arduino Timing System

Data Analysis:
Various analyses used to diagnose experiment equipment, input settings, etc. Plot histograms, scatter plots, curve fit parameters, etc.

Other Python scripts compiled on local machines to be edited for clarity before upload to repository in the near future.
