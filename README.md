Repository of Python scripts written for hardware operation and data analysis in a liquid argon Rayleigh scattering length measurement project.


Hardware:
Operate various experiment components, including:
1. Monochromator
2. Shutter
3. Arduino Timing System


Data Analysis:
Extensive suite of analyses used to diagnose experiment equipment, input setting performance, understand mechanisms, etc. Plot histograms, scatter plots, curve fit parameters, etc. to measure the Rayleigh scattering length.


Other Python scripts compiled on local machines to be edited for clarity before upload to repository in the near future.
