Python programs for hardware operation and data analysis in a liquid argon Rayleigh scattering length measurement.


Hardware:
Operate experiment components, including:
1. Monochromator
2. Shutter
3. Arduino Timing System


Data Analysis:
Suite of analyses for diagnosis of experiment equipment, input of setting performance, and more. Plot histograms, scatter plots, curve fit parameters, etc. to measure the Rayleigh scattering length.


Other Python scripts compiled on local machines to be edited for clarity before upload to this repository.
